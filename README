This is a very basic Python interpreter written as a side-project for my
Honors Operating Systems class. The goal of the class was to build a
fully-functional Unix-like operating system with various features such as
a shell, graphics, text editors, compilers, and interpreters, and my
contribution was this interpreter.

If you look around the code you may find implementations of functions
already defined in the C standard library. I wrote my own implementations
as our class operating system did not have the C standard library on it.

Please note that this is by no means a completed project.
